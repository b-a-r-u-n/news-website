# JAVASCRIPT

This JavaScript code is setting up an event listener for different buttons (#politics, #cricket,
#job) and an input field (#btn) to fetch news articles based on the user's selection or input. It
uses the News API to retrieve news data based on the query parameter provided. The fetched data is
then displayed on the webpage by creating card elements for each article with its image, title,
description, source, and publication date. Clicking on a card will open the corresponding article in
a new tab.
